An interesting sampling of dependencies
Find disparity in height and salary for age cohorts separated by gender
  self = [#person name age salary height gender]
  other = [#person gender]
  other != self
  abs(age - other.age) < 10
  ∂_salary = salary - other.salary
  ∂_height = height - other.height
  maintain
    [#div sort: ∂_salary, children:
      [#div text: "name: {name} age: {age}"]
      [#div text: "∂ salary: {∂_salary}"]
      [#div text: "∂ height: {∂_height}"]]
