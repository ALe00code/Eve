# Inspector

The inspector ("don't panic" button) is Eve's interactive debugging tool. It acts as a go between to help the Analyzer understand what's wrong based on your input. It handles the subset of issues that Eve can't know about a priori, where the program is valid and reasonable but not behaving as you intend; e.g.:

- *"I shouldn't be able to see this button when I'm not logged in."*
- *"The student attendance list is missing."*
- *"Too many emails were sent to each client."*
- *"The clock hand in the wrong position."*
- *"This program slow."*

Once Eve understands what the issue is, it provides a set of structured questions to work backwards through the symptoms to the source. Just telling you "the block labelled 'draw a sign out button when logged in' drew the sign out button" is worse than useless. However, with a little help from you ("that user shouldn't have the tag `#logged-in` right now), Eve can work backwards and say "the `#logged-in` tag was never removed from the user because she did not have an email attribute.

When you've arrived at the root of the problem, the inspector provides tools to figure out why it happened. If, instead a missing attribute, the issue involved incorrect values (perhaps the result of mathematical error), Eve can show you intermediates to find where the breakdown occurs. When too many or too few rows match a pattern, Eve can show you the cardinality of the actions in a block to get a sense of why the numbers don't add up. Some issues the inspector can help diagnose can be found in  the **Example Scenarios** section.


```
commit @inspector
  [#inspector]
```

## Events

When an inspector alt-click comes in, retarget the inspector to the alt-clicked entity/element. Kill any existing states as well.

```
search @event
  event = [#inspector #inspect #direct-target target type x y]

search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector]

commit @inspector
  inspector <- [target type state: ("popout", "annotate-blocks") x y]
  inspector.avs := none

commit @event
  event := none
```

While the inspector is open on an element, update its avs to that element's avs. This will persist until it's no longer potentially relevant.
@NOTE: This is kind of weird and it may be better to have multiple targets instead.

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector target type: "element"]

search @browser
  lookup[record: target, attribute, value]

commit @inspector
  inspector.avs := [attribute value]
```

When an inspector clear event comes in, remove all current inspection state.

```
search @event
  [#inspector #clear]

search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector]

commit @inspector
  inspector.target := none
  inspector.type := none
  inspector.state := none
  inspector.x := none
  inspector.y := none
  inspector.avs := none
```

Clear the clear event
```
search @event
  event = [#inspector #clear]

commit @event
  event := none
```

When an inspector button is pressed, activate any new states we want to transition into.

```
search @event
  [#click #direct-target element]

search @browser
  element = [#button inspector activate]

commit @inspector
  inspector.state += activate
```

When an inspector button is pressed, deactivate any old states we may have been in that want to leave.

```
search @event
  [#click #direct-target element]

search @browser
  element = [#button inspector deactivate]

commit @inspector
  inspector.state -= deactivate
```


## Data

As the inspector states change, it will need to gather different data from the editor and language service. Data requests will be added to the `data` attribute and requests for that data will be bound for so long as those values exist. By gathering all the data in a separate pass, UI to display it can share the same data and be written immediate-mode style.

Certain kinds of data depend on other data.

```
commit @inspector
  [#data data: "sources"]
  [#data data: "related" requires: "sources"]
  [#data data: "cardinalities" requires: "related"]
  [#data data: "values" requires: "related"]
  [#data data: "all-values" requires: "related"]
  [#data data: "affectors"]
  [#data data: "affector-failures" requires: "affectors"]
```

If we need data that has a dependency, make sure we're fetching that too.

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector data]
  [#data data requires]

bind @inspector
  inspector.data += requires
```

### Sources

Find source(s) for the current record.

```
search @inspector
  [#inspector data: "sources" target: record]

bind @editor
  [#find-source record]
```

### Related

Find related(s) for the current record's source action(s).

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector data: "related" target: record]

search @editor
  [#source record span]

bind @editor
  [#find-related inspector | span]
```

### Values

Find the intermediate values that contribute to the currently targeted record.

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector data: "values" target avs: [attribute value]]

search @editor
  [#source record: target block span]
  [#related span variable]

bind @editor
  [#find-value inspector | variable given: [attribute value]]
```

### All Values

Find all intermediate values for the current target's related variable(s).

```
search @inspector
  (inspector, target) = if i = [#inspector data: "all-values" target] then (i, target)
                        else if i = [#inspector data: "values" target not(avs)] then (i, target)

search @editor
  [#source record: target block span]
  [#related span variable]

bind @editor
  [#find-value inspector | variable]
```

### Cardinalities

Find cardinalities for the current target's related variable(s).

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector data: "cardinalities" target]

search @editor
  [#source record: target block span]
  [#related span variable]

bind @editor
  [#find-cardinality inspector | variable]
```

### Affectors

Find the set of blocks that could affect the currently targeted record.

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector data: "affectors" target]

bind @editor
  [#find-affector record: target attribute: "children"]
```

### Affector Failures

Find the reasons why affectors of the current target failed.

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector data: "affector-failures" target]

search @editor
  [#affector record: target block]

bind @editor
  [#find-failure block]
```

## States

Inspector states control how the inspector interacts with the editor and presents itself to the user.

Certain states require data to be fetched.

```
commit @inspector
  [#state state: "focus-blocks" requires: "sources"]
  [#state state: "annotate-blocks" requires: "sources"]
  [#state state: "highlight-related" requires: "related"]
  [#state state: "show-values-inline" requires: "values"]
  [#state state: "show-values-table" requires: "values"]
  [#state state: "show-cardinalities-inline" requires: "cardinalities"]
  [#state state: "focus-affectors" requires: "affectors"]
  [#state state: "annotate-affectors" requires: "affectors"]
  [#state state: "focus-failures" requires: "affector-failures"]
  [#state state: "annotate-failures" requires: "affector-failures"]
  [#state state: "highlight-failures" requires: "affector-failures"]

When the inspector is in a state that requires data, request that data.

```
search @inspector
  [#state state requires]
  inspector = [#inspector state]

bind @inspector
  inspector.data += requires
```

### Focus Blocks

When the `"focus-blocks"` state is active, elide everything but the originating blocks for the current target.

bind @editor
  [#mark-span inspector type: "highlight" | token: variable]
```

### Show Values Inline

When the `"show-values-inline"` state is active, badge any found intermediate values.

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector state: "show-values-inline" target]

search @editor
  [#source record: target block span]
  [#related span variable]
  [#value variable value row: 1]

bind @editor
  [#mark-span inspector type: "badge" kind: "intermediate" target message: value token: variable]
```

### Show Values Table

When the `"show-values-table"` state is active, embed a table of found intermediate values.

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector state: "show-values-table" target]

search @editor
  [#source record: target block span]
  [#related span variable]
  [#value variable value row name]

bind @view
  row-guy = [row]
  lookup[record: row-guy attribute: name value]
  table = [#table inspector | field: name row: row-guy]

bind @browser
  table.span := block
```

### Show Cardinalities Inline

When the `"show-cardinalities-inline"` state is active, badge any found cardinalities.

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector state: "show-cardinalities-inline" target]

search @editor
  [#source record: target block span]
  [#related span variable]
  [#cardinality variable cardinality]

bind @editor
  [#mark-span inspector type: "badge" kind: "cardinality" target message: cardinality | token: variable]
```

### Focus Affectors

When the `"focus-affectors"` state is active, elide everything but the blocks which could impact the target.

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector state: "focus-affectors" target]

search @editor
  [#affector record: target block action]

bind @editor
  [#mark-between inspector type: "elision_transient" | token: block]
  [#mark-span inspector type: "highlight" | token: action]
```

### Annotate Affectors

When the `"annotate-affectors"` state is active, annotate blocks which could impact the target.

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector state: "annotate-affectors" target]

search @editor
  [#affector record: target block action]

bind @editor
  [#mark-span inspector type: "block_annotation" token: block kind: "affector" message: "This block affects the inspected value."]
  [#jump-to token: block]
```

### Focus Failures

When the `"focus-failures"` state is active, elide everything but the blocks which could impact the target but did not.

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector state: "focus-failures" target]

search @editor
  [#affector record: target block action]
  [#failure block]

bind @editor
  [#mark-between inspector type: "elision_transient" | token: block]
  [#mark-span inspector type: "highlight" | token: action]
```

### Annotate Failures

When the `"annotate-failures"` state is active, annotate the blocks which could impact the target.

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector state: "annotate-failures" target]

search @editor
  [#affector record: target block action]
  [#failure block]

bind @editor
  [#mark-span inspector type: "block_annotation" token: block kind: "failure" message: "This block could affect the inspected value but failed."]
  [#jump-to token: block]
```

### Highlight Failures

When the `"highlight-failures"` state is active, show the failing reasons for blocks that impact the target.

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector state: "highlight-failures" target]

search @editor
  [#affector record: target block]
  [#failure block start stop]

bind @editor
  [#mark-range type: "cause-of-failure" start stop]
```

## Drawing

When an `#inspector` is open with type `"element"` and a target, show the element popout.

```
search @inspector
  inspector = [#inspector state: "popout" target]
  x = inspector.x
  y = inspector.y + 15

bind @view
  attributes = [#attribute-table inspector entity: target]

bind @browser
  inspector <-
    [#div #editor #inspector target x y class: "inspector-pane" children:
      [#div #attributes-panel children: attributes]
      [#div #options-panel class: "buttons" children:
        [#button inspector text: "Find events" deactivate: "popout"]
        [#button inspector text: "Why this?" activate: "show-values-table" deactivate: "popout"]
        [#button inspector text: "Too few? Too many?" activate: "show-cardinalities-inline" deactivate: "popout"]
        [#button inspector text: "Not drawing?" activate: ("annotate-affectors", "highlight-failures") deactivate: ("annotate-blocks", "popout")]]]
```
