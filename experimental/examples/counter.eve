    counter = [#counter count]
  bind @browser
    [#div counter class: "counter-container", children:

      [#div class: "count", sort: 1, text: count]
      [#div #count-button class: "button", sort: 2, text: "+", diff: 1, counter]]

```
  match (@browser, @session)
    [#click element: [#count-button diff counter]]
  commit @session
